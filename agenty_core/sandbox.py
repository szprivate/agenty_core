"""What ``run_script`` is allowed to run, and where it is allowed to point.

``run_script`` used to be ``subprocess.run(command, shell=True)`` with no checks
at all. That is a general-purpose remote shell attached to a language model, and
it is reached by anything that can put a sentence in front of that model — a web
page talking to the host, a prompt injected through a downloaded file, or simply
the model deciding, wrongly, that deleting something would help.

**What this can and cannot promise.** A path filter over a *shell string* is
theatre: you cannot decide what ``foo | bash -c "$(echo …)"`` will touch without
writing a shell. So the string stops being a shell string. ``shlex`` splits it,
``shell=False`` runs it, and the whole class of quoting, chaining and substitution
attacks is gone — not mitigated, absent, because there is no shell left to attack.

What remains is one program with literal arguments, and that is small enough to
reason about:

* the program must be one we named (:data:`DEFAULT_EXECUTABLES`). ``ffmpeg`` and
  ``grep`` are here because real skills use them; ``bash``, ``curl`` and
  ``osascript`` are not, because a general interpreter or a network client makes
  the rest of the list pointless.
* every argument that names a path must resolve inside a root we allow. This one
  is a genuine limit rather than a guarantee — a program handed a relative path
  can still write relative to its working directory, which is why the working
  directory is set explicitly instead of inherited.

The remaining hole is deliberate and documented: an allowed program can be asked
to do an unwanted thing inside an allowed root. ``src.utils.tool_permissions`` is
what covers that, by asking a person.
