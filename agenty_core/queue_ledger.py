"""Which items in ComfyUI's queue this agent put there.

Stop used to mean ``POST /interrupt``, which ends the job that is *running* and
nothing else. A run is usually several prompts deep — a batch member per variant,
a repaired graph re-queued behind the original — so stopping killed the current
one and then watched ComfyUI cheerfully start the next. Pressing stop repeatedly
until the queue drained was the only way to actually stop.

Clearing the whole queue instead would be worse. The user queues their own work in
the same ComfyUI, and a stop button that threw away somebody's overnight batch
because an agent was also running is not a stop button anybody would press twice.

So we keep note. Every prompt agentY submits is recorded here, and stopping
deletes exactly the pending items in this ledger — never one we did not put there.
Identity by prompt id rather than by ``client_id``: a client_id is generated fresh
per submission (it is the websocket correlation key), so it identifies a job, not
an owner. The ids we hold are the ones we were handed by ``POST /prompt``, which
makes "ours" a fact rather than a guess.

The ledger is per process and deliberately not persisted. A prompt id from a host
that has since exited is not something this host should be deleting.
