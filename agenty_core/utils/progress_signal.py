"""
progress_signal – Thread-safe buffer for mid-tool progress lines.

Sync tools (e.g. download_hf_model) push formatted progress lines here
via ``push()``.  The async pipeline drains them via ``drain()`` and yields
each line as a ``{"data": "..."}`` event so Chainlit can display them.

Usage from a tool:
    from agenty_core.utils.progress_signal import push as push_progress
    push_progress("⬇️ [████░░░░░░] 45% …")

Usage from the pipeline:
    from agenty_core.utils.progress_signal import drain as drain_progress
    for line in drain_progress():
        yield {"data": line}
