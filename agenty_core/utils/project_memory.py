"""Per-project memory — the facts that are true of THIS project, stored beside it.

Where it lives is the whole idea. The store is a folder inside ComfyUI's **user
directory**, and the production pipeline (Ayon, here) already switches that
directory when it switches project, together with input and output. So the memory
follows the project without agentY holding a project id, a config entry, or a
switch of its own: ``get_comfyui_dirs()`` reports the running server's
``--user-directory`` straight out of its argv, and that result is cleared by
``clear_tool_caches()`` at the start of every session — which doubles, for free,
as this module's cache invalidation. Nothing here caches anything itself.

Shape on disk::

    <user_dir>/agentY/project/
      PROJECT.md                  generated index, for humans (never read back)
      technical/aspect-ratio.md
      character/hero.md
      style/grade.md
      reference/alley.md

One fact per file; the type is the folder, the name is the filename, and the
first non-empty line doubles as the summary the index shows. No frontmatter: these
files are meant to be opened in a text editor and synced by the pipeline, so the
format has to survive a human editing one by hand.

Deliberately NOT the FAISS store in ``src/utils/memory.py``. That one answers
"what have we learned, roughly, about this kind of task" by similarity, which is
the right model for lessons. This one answers "what is the hero's prompt" — by
name, exactly, every time.
