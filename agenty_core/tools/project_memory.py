"""agentY – @tool access to the per-project memory store.

The store itself is described in ``src/utils/project_memory.py``: one fact per
file, in a folder inside ComfyUI's user directory, so it switches with the project
when the pipeline switches ComfyUI's user/input/output directories.

These two tools are the *on-demand* half. The always-on half is the
``[PROJECT MEMORY]`` block the pipeline injects into every turn — the agent sees
what exists without asking, and calls ``project_memory_read`` only for the entries
it actually needs in full.

    defined**. A character described once has a stored description; reinventing it
    is how shot 4 stops matching shot 1.

    This is project state, not a lesson: what the hero looks like, how the grade
    is described, which reference image is the locked one, what aspect ratio this
    production delivers in. It lives beside the project and switches with it, so
    write things that are true of *this* project and would be wrong for the next.
    Use ``memory_write`` instead for things true of the user across all projects.

    Write it the way you would want to read it cold, and put the most identifying
    line first — that first line is what every later turn sees in the injected
    block. Writing the same name again REPLACES the entry, which is how you update
    a fact; there is no append.

    Store reference images as a path relative to ComfyUI's input directory when you
    can, so the entry survives the project moving between machines.

    Args:
        name: Short handle to recall it by, e.g. "hero", "grade", "aspect-ratio".
        content: The fact itself. A prompt fragment, a guide, a path — whatever a
                 later turn needs verbatim.
        type: One of "technical", "character", "style", "reference", "note".
              "technical" entries are injected into every turn IN FULL (aspect
              ratios, resolutions, fps), so keep those short; everything else is
