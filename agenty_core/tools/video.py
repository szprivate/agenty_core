"""Shot detection and splitting.

``split_video_into_shots`` finds where a video cuts and writes one file per shot,
so a supplied clip can be worked on shot by shot — restyle one, feed each to a
per-shot workflow, or just find out where the cuts are before deciding anything.

Two halves, and they fail differently, which is why they are kept apart below:
**detection** is PySceneDetect reading the frames, and **cutting** is ffmpeg
writing the files. A machine can perfectly well detect and be unable to write
(no ffmpeg), so the cut list is still reported when that happens rather than the
whole call coming back as a failure.

    ``detect_only=True`` first when you are unsure of the settings: that reads the

    Args:
        file_path: The video to split. A path, or a bare filename sitting in
            ComfyUI's input dir.
        detector: ``content`` (default) compares consecutive frames — right for
            edited footage with hard cuts. ``adaptive`` scores against a rolling
            window instead, which stops fast camera motion, whip pans and strobes
            from reading as cuts; use it on handheld or high-motion material.
        threshold: Sensitivity. LOWER finds more cuts. 27.0 suits ``content``; for
            ``adaptive`` the comparable default is 3.0. If a known cut is missed,
            lower it; if one shot comes back split into several, raise it.
        min_shot_seconds: Ignore any shot shorter than this (default 0.4), so a
            flash frame or a one-frame glitch is not reported as a shot.
        detect_only: Report where the cuts are and write nothing.
        output_dir: Where the shots go. Defaults to a ``<name>_shots`` folder
            under the agent's videos directory.
        fast: Stream-copy instead of re-encoding. LEAVE THIS OFF unless you know
            the source is keyframe-dense: a copy can only start on a keyframe, and
            generated video (ComfyUI's savers, most model APIs) is usually written
            with a single keyframe at the start, which makes every shot run from
            the beginning of the file. That is detected and re-cut properly rather
            than returned, so the cost of asking for it wrongly is wasted time,
            not wrong files — but it buys nothing on that footage.
        max_shots: Stop writing after this many (default 200). Detection still
            reports everything it found.
