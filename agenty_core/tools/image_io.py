"""Getting image files in and out — the parts that do not depend on the host.

Three things every host needs and none of them needs its own version of:

* **staging a local file** into ComfyUI's input dir, so a ``LoadImage`` can read
  it (with the resolution and idempotency rules that make a bare canvas filename
  work);
* **fetching a web image** straight into that same input dir;
* **PUT-ing a local file to a presigned URL**, which is the upload half of every
  MCP creation flow.

What is deliberately NOT here is anything about showing an image to a model.
``analyze_image`` and ``view_image`` diverge for a real reason — the Strands app
delegates to a Vision Agent to keep pixels out of the orchestrator's context,
while an MCP host looks at the image itself — so they stay in each repo. The
byte-wrangling underneath them is shared, in
:mod:`agenty_core.utils.image_bytes`.

    and can then be referenced directly by a ``LoadImage`` node using the returned
    ``name`` and ``subfolder`` — no separate upload call is needed.

    Args:
        image_url: Direct http/https URL of the image.
        subfolder: Input-dir subfolder to store the image in. Empty (the default)
                   puts it in the input root, which is the safe choice: LoadImage

        downsize:  When True (default), oversized images are downscaled to the
                   5 MB / 1568 px limit so they stay usable everywhere (matching
                   how user-uploaded images are handled). False keeps the original.

    exactly as a generated image is. So downloading IS showing: do not follow it
    by building or editing a workflow to display the picture, and do not offer to.

    Returns:

        "size_bytes", "source_url"}`` on success, or ``{"error": "<message>"}``.
